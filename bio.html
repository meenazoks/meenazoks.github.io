                <p>
                    Hi there! As listed above, I am currently studying Computer Science. I am most passionate
                    about backend development and hope to pursue a job in software engineering after finishing my
                    undergraduate degree.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As can be seen in my resume (linked above) I have worked at a law firm for the past three years.
                    I am hoping to attend law school after a couple years of industry experience, and combine these two
                    fields of study by becoming a patent lawyer, or something similiar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of school, I love to spend my free time cooking, reading, and exercising
                    (preferably outside when it's not below freezing :) ).
