            <p>
                Hi there! As listed above, I am currently studying Computer Science. I am most passionate
                about backend development and hope to pursue a job in software engineering after finishing my
                undergraduate degree.
            </p>

            <p>
                As can be seen in my resume (linked above) I have worked at a law firm for the past three years.
                I am hoping to attend law school after a couple years of industry experience, and combine these two
                fields of study by becoming a patent lawyer, or something similiar.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of school, I love to spend my free time cooking, reading, and exercising.
            </p>
